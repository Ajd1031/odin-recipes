        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Steak is a meal that can be enjoyed by anyone and can be cooked in many ways. This recipe in particular will utilize a cast iron skillet to maximize taste
            and guarantee a good sear.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Steak (Personal favorite is ribeye, but anyting will suffice</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of clarified butter</li>
            <li>Minced garlic or fresh gralic if you are willing to mince it yourself</li>
            <li>Thyme</li>
            <li>Cast-iron skillet</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directons</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove excess fat and any skin on steak. (I like to leave a little fat on but this is all about personl preference.
                When the cut is how you desire it, sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. 
            </li>
            <li>Heat skillet over high heat and add olive oil.</li>
            <li>Add in steak once the oil has heated up. (The oil will glide across the pan once it is hot enough. If there is steam coming from the 
                oil turn the heat down.)
            </li>
            <li>Depending on thickness of steak cook for 3-4 minutes on each side</li>
            <li>Now turn heat to medium and add in butter, thyme, and garlic</li>
            <li>Once butter melted spoon it onto the of the steak for 1-2 minutes</li>
            <li>Let rest on cool plate for 1-2 minutes and serve. (If you would like, you may drizzle the rest of the oil/butter in pan on top of 
                the steak
            </li>

        </ol>
